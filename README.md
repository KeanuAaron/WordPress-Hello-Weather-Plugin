# WordPress-Hello-Weather-Plugin
This is the very first plugin I ever created. This plugin is similar to "Hello Dolly", except that it just displays the local weather of the user signed in based on their IP Address. This info isn't used anywhere or even saved. It's just a learning experience for developing wordpress plugins.
